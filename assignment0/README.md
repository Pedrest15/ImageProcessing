# How to do assignments

In this assignment, a simple "pixel selector" was implemented: 
given a pixel coordinate, its value is printed as output. Follow the instructions carefully:

1. Load the input image.
2. Get the value of the pixel located at the (i, j) coordinates specified in the input
3. Print the value of that pixel in a single line with R, G and B values separated by
a single space.

## Input Parameters

The following parameters were used as input in the following order:
1. filename imginput for the input image
2. the first dimension of the coordinate, i
3. the second dimension of the coordinate, j
