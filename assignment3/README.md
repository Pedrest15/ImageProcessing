# Morphology + Color

<div align="justify" >

In this assignment, functions were implemented to process images in order to identify
regions of interest (ROIs) using a heatmap. Your program must follow these steps:

## Read the parameters:
a) Filename for the input image ( I ). </br>
b) Filename for the reference image ( H ). </br>
c) Technique indexes i ∈ M = {1, 2}. </br>

## Implement the techniques below:
a) index i = 1 - Erosion. </br>
b) index i = 2 - Dilation. </br>
c) Adaptive Limiarization (Otsu). </br>

## Process the input images:
a) Convert the input image in Grayscale. </br>
b) Apply Adaptive Limiarization (Otsu) to binarize the image. </br>
c) Create the binary mask by applying the sequence of Erosions and Dilations. </br>
d) Create the heatmap. </br>
e) Create the colored mask as a combination of the heatmap and the binary mask. </br>
f) Create the image ( G ) combining the image ( I ) with the colored mask. </br>
g) Compare the created image ( G ) with the reference image ( H ). </br>

## Comparing against reference

The program compares the created image G against the reference image H.
This comparison uses the root mean squared error (RMSE).

$$ RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i\sum_j(H(i,j) - G(i,j))^2}{M \cdot N}} $$

where $`M × N`$ is the resolution of images H and G.

Considering that images are composed of 3 channels (R, G, B), it is compute the RMSE
for each channel separately (as presented in the equation above) and calculate the average among
them.

$$ RMSE_{color} = \frac{RMSE_{red} + RMSE_{green} + RMSE_{blue}}{3} $$

## Examples

At the end of execution, the input image I, the mask, the filter used, the grayscale I,
the colored imagem, the mixed image,and H images are displayed, allowing for visual comparison.

![Execution Example](Example.png)

In folder `test_cases_in_out` there are files `caseX.in` and `casesX.out` where 
_.in_ contains input examples and _.out_ contains the respective output. Note that, when run
locally, RMSE values may vary by 0.75 due to specific machine errors.

To run `main.py` with an example, use that line: `python3 main.py < test_cases_in_out/caseX.in`
